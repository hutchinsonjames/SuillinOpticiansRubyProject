Project Description:

The aim of this project is to design and develop an e-commerce based web application for the domain/business 
of your choice (e.g. an online music shop). 

This e-commerce site will allow users to log onto the site and browse the inventory by various attributes, 
e.g. product name, manufacturer, model etc. A user can register with your site to make allow for purchases on 
the site. Once registered, the user can add items to his or her cart. Items can be added and removed by the 
user as he or she browses the inventory. Once the user is ready to make a purchase the user is brought to a 
payment page where details on what is in the userâ€™s cart is given to the user and a total price is also provided. 
The user can then make a payment for the purchases.
